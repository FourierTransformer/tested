# Roadmap

I'm planning to start off by seeing if `tested` catches on, and see what features/criticism/feedback people give and likely go from there. I'm planning to wait a bit (could be a year) before fully committing to a v1 and stabilizing the CLI and API.

Things that I am one day planning to add:

- [ ] A couple more formatters (TAP and maybe a condensed one) [#21](https://github.com/FourierTransformer/tested/issues/21)
- [ ] A [pure Lua](./pure-lua.md) single-file distribution [#20](https://github.com/FourierTransformer/tested/issues/20)
- [ ] File output (alongside terminal)
    - A cool fancy HTML output with the tests and coverage could be fun [#14](https://github.com/FourierTransformer/tested/issues/14)
- [ ] Test timeouts [#3](https://github.com/FourierTransformer/tested/issues/3)
- [ ] Likely other things as well!

If there are any things you would really want to see added to a Unit testing framework, feel free to [open up a discussion](https://github.com/FourierTransformer/tested/discussions/new/choose). I'm currently open to new ideas!
