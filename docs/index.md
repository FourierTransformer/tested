# `tested`

`tested` is a new Lua (and [Teal](https://teal-language.org)) unit testing framework! It's designed to be simple to use, provide enough information to make results actionable, and one day run everywhere Lua does.


## Inspiration


## Does the Lua ecosystem need _another_ unit testing framework?
This is honestly a question that went through my mind many times while working on `tested`. [busted](https://github.com/lunarmodules/busted) already handles unit testing for many projects and does it well. Major thanks to everyone who's helped maintain it over the years. I've used it for years and it's always worked for what I needed. `tested` mostly grew out of my desire to _build_ a unit testing framework - one whose core was pure-Lua and needed as few external libraries as possible. If it ends up being a library that only I use, that's okay with me. The journey was definitely worth it, since I had a lot of fun making it.
