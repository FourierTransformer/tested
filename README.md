# tested

We're still early days here! I wouldn't even say it's ready for contributors, mostly just me playing with a unit testing framework. I was reading up on unit testing frameworks and was looking for one that worked with Teal while working on tinytoml.

Check back later to see if I'll commit long[er] term.

## Trying it

This will execute the test files in `tests`:

```
tl run src/tested/main.tl
```

## Licences
Parts of the following are included in the source code:
- Bundles a slightly modified [inspect.lua](https://github.com/kikito/inspect.lua) for table diffing and viewing - MIT
